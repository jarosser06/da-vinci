Audit documentation for code examples and objective language.

**CRITICAL**: You MUST activate ALL skills listed in frontmatter using the Skill tool before proceeding.

Steps:
1. **REQUIRED**: Activate skill: `Skill(doc-audit)`
2. Perform comprehensive audit of the da_vinci Sphinx documentation

Focus on:

1. **Code Example Validation**
   - Verify all import paths are correct
   - Check class definitions and attributes match implementation
   - Validate API method signatures and parameters
   - Ensure examples are complete and runnable

2. **Subjective Language Detection**
   - Flag subjective adverbs (easily, simply, quickly, etc.)
   - Flag subjective adjectives (powerful, elegant, amazing, etc.)
   - Flag marketing language and superlatives
   - Suggest objective alternatives

3. **Common Issues**
   - Check for outdated APIs
   - Verify version compatibility
   - Ensure prerequisites are listed
   - Validate command-line examples

Generate a comprehensive audit report with:
- Executive summary
- Issues found per file
- Severity ratings (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Specific line numbers
- Suggested fixes
- Recommendations

Prioritize accuracy of code examples over language issues.
