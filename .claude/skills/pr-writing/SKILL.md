# PR Writing

**Description**: Create concise, objective pull request descriptions. Use when creating PRs.

## PR Format

```markdown
## Summary
[1-2 sentences: what changed]

Closes #{issue_number}

## Changes
- [Specific change 1]
- [Specific change 2]

## Tests Added
- [Specific test 1]
- [Specific test 2]
```

## Key Principles

1. **Keep it short**: 1-2 sentence summary
2. **Objective language**: No "improved", "enhanced", "powerful", "elegant"
3. **List what changed**: Specific changes only
4. **List new tests**: What tests were added, not coverage metrics
5. **Link issue**: Always include "Closes #N" or "Fixes #N"
